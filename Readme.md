## Introduction
 
### What is GoogleCloudReady Facilitator program?
The GoogleCloudReady Facilitator program will provide you an opportunity to kickstart your career in cloud and get hands on practice on Google Cloud - the tool that powers apps like Google Search, Gmail and YouTube.

Along the way, you will learn & practice concepts like computing, application development, big data & machine learning using cloud & if you get stuck, you will have your "Facilitators" who are specially trained on Google Cloud to help.

### Why should you participate in the program?
- You can showcase what you've learned here to your professional network **using Google Cloud-hosted quest & skill badges** that you can add to your resume and professional profiles like LinkedIn.
- And on top of these amazing badges, you get a chance to **win some really cool Google Cloud goodies**.

### Program's Syllabus
The program will introduce you to Computing, Application Development, Big Data & Machine Learning using Google Cloud's training platform called Google Cloud Skills Boost where you will learn each of these topic using self-paced labs that provides you temporary credentials to Google Cloud Platform, so you can learn the cloud using the real thing â€“ no simulations.

### About the Repository 
In this repository I have curated the code-doucmentation of the challenging labs as well as the labs in which mostly students face diffciulties to help them to get insights from the repository for the Challeneging Labs.So that they can learn and grow their knowledge.
